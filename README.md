# eshoponcontainersjava
For self purposes I am creating Java implementation of eShopOnContainers inspired by below respository:
https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnAzure/tree/master/src/Services

So far I have setup following

1. Identity service using keycloak
2. Discovery service using Spring Cloud
3. Catalog service that uses JPA.
4. Secrets are stored using Docker swarm

Much more to follow as I keep on developing this Repository
